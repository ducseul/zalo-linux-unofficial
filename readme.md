### Zalo for Linux (Unofficial Port)
<b>Information</b>
--
THIS IS NOT USING THE ZALO WEBSITE,IT IS PORTED DIRECTLY FROM THE ZALO MAC DESKTOP CLIENT YOU CAN'T CALL</br>
This project is an unofficial port of the MacOS version of Zalo to Linux. The porting process involved extracting the `.dmg` file from the MacOS version and locating the `app.asar` file in the directory, which is typically found in `/Applications/YourAppName.app/Contents/Resource`
